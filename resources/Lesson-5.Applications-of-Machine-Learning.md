# Lesson - 5. Applications of Machine Learning 

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning Algorithms are a special case of ML algorithms and have the capability of learning a accurately complex, non-linear functions from the data.

*Characteristics* - 
- Highly effective in learning multi-dimensional, non-linear functions
- Massive amount of training data
- Excels with raw, unstructured data
- Automatic feature extraction
- Computationally expensive

*Benefits* - 
1. Non-parametric approach taken by neural nets allow them to learn arbitrally complex functions
2. Learn complex patterns without explicitly seeing them
3. Effective across various types of data
4. Work on very large sets of data
5. Can be distributed for parallel training 
6. Learn time-related patterns
7. Capable of reaching on-par performance with certain human activities

*Applications* -

## Similarity Learning
### Classification Approach 
Similarity function maps pairs of entitiies to a finite number of similarity level

### Regression Approach
Similarity function maps pairs of entities to numerical values

### Ranking Similarity Approach 
A variation of this approach where supervision form is weakened from an exact measure to an ordering measure
