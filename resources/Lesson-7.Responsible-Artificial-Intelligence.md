**Two essential aspects of ML models that impact responsible Artificial Intelligence - Transparency and Explainability**


## Worries about Responsible Artificial Intelligence
1. Increasing Inequality
2. Weaponization
3. Unintentional Bias
4. Adversarial Attack
5. Killer Drones 
6. Deep Fakes
7. Data Poisioning
8. Hype


## Approaches of Responsible Artificial Intelligence
- Model Explainability: Global bahavior, specific predictions
- Evaluate a model for fairness


## Six principles guiding Microsoft Responsible AI Development and use
1. **F**airness 
2. **R**eliability and Safety
3. **P**rivacy and Security
4. **I**nclusiveness
5. **T**ransparency
6. **A**ccountability 

*Transparency* and *Accountability* ensure effectiveness of other principles
