# Lesson - 6.Managed Services for Machine Learning

## Types of Computing Resources available through managed services
1. Training Compute 
2. Inferencing Compute
3. Notebook Environment


## Difference between Conventional Machine Learning Approach and Managed Service Approach
**Conventional Machine Learning Approach** -
- Lengthy installation and setup process
- Expertise to configure network
- Fair amount of troubleshooting

**Managed Service Approach** - 
- Very little setup
- Easy configuration for any needed hardware


## Compute Resources
Compute Target is a designated compute resource/environment where one run training scripts/host ones services deployment. Two types - 
1. Training Compute Target
2. Inferencing Compute Targets

**Computes used for training** - 
- Training Clusters
- Compute Instances
- Local Compute


## Training Clusters
They are used for training and batch inferencing
1. Single/multi-mode cluster
2. Can auto scale each time one submit a run
3. Automate cluster management and job scheduling 
4. Support for both CPU and GPU resources


## Inferencing/Scoring Compute 
*Types* -
- Real time 
- Batch

*STEPS involved*:
   - After one has trained ones model, its ready to put to work
