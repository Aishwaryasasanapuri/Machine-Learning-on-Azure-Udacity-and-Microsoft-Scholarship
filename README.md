## Libraries used in Machine Learning 
1. **Core Framework and Tools**
-	*Python* is a very popular high-level programming language that is great for data science.
-	*Pandas* is an open-source Python library designed for analyzing and manipulating data, particularly good for working with tabular data and time-series data.
-	*NumPy* is a Python library which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays of data, and has many high-level mathematical functions that can be used to perform operations on these arrays.

2. **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
-	*Scikit-Learn* is designed to be integrated with other scientific and data-analysis libraries.
-	*Apache Spark* is an open-source analytics engine that is designed for cluster-computing and that is often used for large-scale data processing and big data.
-	*TensorFlow* is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by Google Brain.
-	*Keras* is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries. It's designed for rapid development and experimentation.
-	*PyTorch* is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by Facebook's AI Research lab. 

3. **Data Visualization**
-	*Plotly* is a company that provides a number of different front-end tools for machine learning and data scienceâ€”including an open source graphing library for Python.
-	*Matplotlib* is a Python library designed for plotting 2D visualizations. It can be used to produce graphs and other figures that are high quality and usable in professional publications.
-	*Seaborn* is a Python library designed specifically for data visualization. It provides a more high-level interface and has additional features for making visualizations more attractive and informative.
-	*Bokeh* is an interactive data visualization library. It generates visualizations in HTML and JavaScript.
