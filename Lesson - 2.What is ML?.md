# Lesson-2.What is Machine Learning?

## Machine Learning 
Data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data and forecast future outcomes, behaviours and trends.
```
*Rules   + Data = Traditional Programming*      
*Answers + Data = Machine Learning*
```

## Applications of Machine Learning 
1. Natural Language Processing 
   - Text: Summarization, Topic Detection, Similarity and Search 
   - Speech: Speech to Text, Text to Speech and Translation
2. Computer Vision 
   - Self Driving Cars
   - Object Detection 
   - Object Identification
   - LIDAR and Visible Spectrum
3. Analytics 
   - **Regression**, **Classification**, Forecasting
   - **Clusering**
4. Decision Making 
   - Sequential decision making problems
   - Recommendations

## Examples of Machine Learning 
I.   Automating recognition of disease
II.  Recommend next best actions for individual care plans
